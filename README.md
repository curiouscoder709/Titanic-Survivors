# Titanic-Survivors

This project contains the full working code for the Titanic Survivors dataset with a comprehensive EDA.

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, and after EDA and preprocessing was done machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbours were used to predict the survival chance with a maximum accuracy of 70% on test data and 80% on training data.
